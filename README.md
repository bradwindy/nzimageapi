# NZImage API

## Intro

This project is WIP. It is a wrapper around the https://digitalnz.org/ API. 

This API returns a random image from the Digital NZ API, which that aggregates archives from libaries and other institutions around NZ.

I intend to publish this as a public API and website where people can easily view content from NZ archives.
